# Hi, I'm Steven.

I'm a software engineering intern at [Ramp](https://ramp.com/), where I'm building the next generation of financial software.

Previously, I worked on a regression testing framework for [Meta Reality Labs](https://tech.facebook.com/reality-labs/), built AI agents for cold outbound at [Paradigm](https://www.paradigmai.com/), and researched graph neural networks with the [Penn ATLAS Group](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/pennatlas/).

I’m also a rising senior at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/), where I serve as a teaching assistant for the operating systems course, [CIS 5480](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis5480/current/).

A little more about me...

- I’m a dancer and choreographer for [Pan Asian Dance Troupe](https://www.panasiandance.com/), Penn’s premier Asian fusion dance troupe.

- I used to do competitive mathematics. I’ve represented Myanmar at several international competitions, and I’m proud to have helped my country [win its first gold medal](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1G7vXeXbhB/) at a major event.

Outside of academics and work, I enjoy [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/147406763), [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/steven_knight), [speedcubing](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2025MINZ01), [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/zminsc), and [writing](https://zminsc.dev/blog). Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zminsc/), check out my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/zminsc), or email me at [me@zminsc.dev](mailto:me@zminsc.dev).
