I’m an incoming software engineering intern at [Ramp](https://ramp.com/), where I’ll be building the next generation of financial software. Previously, I’ve worked on a regression testing framework at [Meta](https://about.meta.com/) and researched graph neural networks with the [Penn ATLAS Group](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/pennatlas/).

I’m also a junior at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/), where I served for two semesters as a teaching assistant for the introductory programming languages course, [CIS 1200](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis120/current/).

A little more about me...

- I’m a dancer and choreographer for [Pan Asian Dance Troupe](https://www.panasiandance.com/), Penn’s premier Asian fusion dance troupe.

- I used to do competitive mathematics. I’ve represented Myanmar at several international competitions, and I’m proud to have helped my country [win its first gold medal](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1G7vXeXbhB/) at a major event.

Outside of academics and work, I enjoy running, chess, speedcubing, writing, and badminton.
