description: I discover the Hanson Marathon Method.

There are two recurring themes I've found in my marathon training research, whether that be from conversations with friends or the [r/Marathon_Training](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/) subreddit. The first is to use my heart rate (HR) to measure the difficulty of my runs, aiming to keep most of my runs in the 150-160 bpm zone. The second is to do at least one 20-mile long run before the marathon begins.

I recently came across the [Hansons Marathon Method](https://books.google.com/books/about/Hansons_Marathon_Method.html?id=glZxrgEACAAJ&hl=en&output=html_text) by Luke Humphrey. Key differences in the Hansons method, compared to traditional marathon training plans or advice, is the emphasis on high weekly volume (up to 60mi/week) and lack of a very long run (the longest run in the plan tops out at 16 miles!). Most of the weekly volume then comes from "easy" runs (45%-55%). I was curious as to what the Hansons considered to be an easy run, so I kept reading on.

> An easy run is usually defined as a run that lasts anywhere between 20 minutes and 2.5 hours at an intensity of 55–75 percent of VO2max. Since most of us don’t have the means to get VO2max tested, the next best thing is to look at pace per mile. The Hansons Marathon Method calls for easy runs to be paced 1–2 minutes slower than goal marathon pace. For example, if your goal marathon pace is 8:00 minutes per mile, then your easy pace should be 9:00–10:00 minutes per mile.

With my goal marathon pace being 3 hours and 45 minutes (8:35min/mi), my easy runs should be taking place at 9:35-10:35min/mi. For context, I've been doing easy runs at about 11:15-11:45min/mi, as that keeps my HR between the 150-160bpm zone. In the interests of seeing what my HR would be at the lower end of the 9:35-10:35min/mi pace range, I did a [morning run today](https://strava.app.link/bARwAPXN4Sb) at around a 10:31min/mi pace. It averaged at mid-160s for most of the run, going up into the 170s towards the end.

I am very interested in the Hansons Marathon Method due to the significant amount of positive feedback I see about it on Reddit (which is rare!) and will be switching over to pace-based training for the next few weeks before I commit to any program.
